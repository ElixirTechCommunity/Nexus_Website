    <h1>ABOUT</h1>

    <p class="box-content-p">As the flagship event for the upcoming Tech Fest Pravaah, the Elixir Community is
        conducting a 24-hour hackathon. The sole purpose of organizing this hackathon is to provide participants a
        chance for hands-on learning, forming strong networks, and mentoring from those currently working in the field.

        An inclusive community where we together can learn, grow, build, share, network & experience various aspects of
        Technology, Sessions, Meetups, Hackathon & many more things which in turn can help us all solve the shared
        struggles of the society.</p>
